# PHP User Login and Registration System: (log-regi-sys)

A system login and user registration, regardless of the framework used.  
If you have ever tried to create a login page / user registration then you know that this is a repetitive task fraught with problems.
I dealt with these problems often therefore attempt in this library provide common tasks: 
persistence, session confirmation email, etc.


## Installation

LOGREGISYS is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require fixwa/UsLoRegSys:dev-master
```

This will require all the components for the Login and Registration System.
